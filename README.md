<h2>üë®‚ÄçüíªMy Projects:üë®‚Äçüíª</h2>


- **Administration Master Lab**
  - [Active Directory Lab](https://github.com/Thuynh808/Active-Directory-Lab/blob/main/README.md)
    - This Active Directory lab simulates a corporate environment with a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller and Windows 10 client in VirtualBox. It includes AD Domain Services, DHCP, RAS/NAT, and Group Policy Objects (GPO) for network and policy management. A Python script automates user creation, providing hands-on experience in system administration and network configuration.
  - [Ubuntu AD Integration](https://github.com/Thuynh808/Ubuntu-AD-Integration/blob/main/README.md)
    - Building on from Active Directory Lab with an Ubuntu Server centralizing user management configuring network settings, joining the Ubuntu Server to the AD domain, setting up Kerberos authentication, and optimizing system configurations.
   
- **Infrastructure Automation and Monitoring**
  - [HPC_CryptoCluster ***(New)***](https://github.com/Thuynh808/HPC_CryptoCluster/blob/main/README.md)
    - Automated deployment of a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster featuring stateless compute nodes with Warewulf, Slurm for job scheduling, and John the Ripper for distributed password cracking. This project highlights the integration of automation, scalability, and cybersecurity testing in an HPC environment.
  - [HA-WebTrack ***(New)***](https://github.com/Thuynh808/HA-WebTrack/blob/main/README.md)
    - A high-availability web server setup built with Ansible, featuring automated infrastructure deployment, load balancing with HAProxy, real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, and hands-on testing for high-load stress and failover scenarios. It emphasizes RHCSA and RHCE practices, using dynamic variables and role-based playbooks for scalability.
  - [Elastic_labs ***(New)***](https://github.com/Thuynh808/elastic_labs/blob/main/README.md)
     - The elastic_labs project is designed to simulate a Elastic Stack environment using Ansible for automated deployment and management. This setup focuses on configuring a comprehensive SIEM system that includes Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fleet, Zeek integration, and Elastic Agents on a controlled RHEL environment.
      
- **Cloud Security Ventures**
  - [The Cyber Streetracker](https://github.com/Thuynh808/TheCyberStreetracker/blob/main/README.md)
    - The Cyber Streetracker is a comprehensive web application designed to provide real-time cybersecurity news and vulnerability search capabilities, leveraging Azure services for robust functionality and security. This project implements advanced features such as OAuth2.0 authentication, Azure Functions, and a Web Application Firewall, ensuring a secure and responsive user experience. 
  - [Live SOC/Honeynet in Azure](https://github.com/Thuynh808/Cloud-SOC/blob/main/README.md)
    - This Azure honeynet project uses Microsoft Sentinel to monitor threats on exposed VMs, SQL Server, Blob Storage, and Key Vault. Initial logs capture vulnerabilities and attacks, which are then reduced by applying Network Security Groups, firewalls, and Private Endpoints. The project showcases how security controls enhance threat detection and protection in Sentinel.

- **Security Operations Center(SOC) Initiatives**
  - [Security Onion SOC Workshop](https://github.com/Thuynh808/Security-Onion-SOC-Workshop/blob/main/README.md)
    - This project builds a virtual SOC environment with Security Onion for malware analysis and network monitoring. Using Zeek, Suricata, Wireshark, and OSINT tools (AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal), it covers importing malicious PCAPs, analyzing alerts, and creating incident reports, providing hands-on SOC experience in threat detection and response.
  - [Project Fishy Phiisshing](https://github.com/Thuynh808/Fishy-Phiisshing/blob/main/README.md)
    - This project automates phishing email collection from GitHub for analysis on a Kali Linux VM. Using Thunderbird, Talos Intelligence, VirusTotal, and PhishTool, it dissects phishing tactics. The final SOC-style report provides insights, technical findings, and recommendations to strengthen defenses against phishing attacks.
  - [Qualys Quest Analysis](https://github.com/Thuynh808/Qualys-Quest-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
    - This project uses Qualys to scan a Windows VM with outdated software in VirtualBox, set up in a NAT network. Vulnerabilities are remediated and tracked, with results visualized in Google Sheets pivot tables to create a trend report, highlighting effective vulnerability management cycle.
