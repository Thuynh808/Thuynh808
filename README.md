<h2>üë®‚ÄçüíªMy Projects:üë®‚Äçüíª</h2>


- **Administration Master Lab**
  - [Active Directory Lab](https://github.com/Thuynh808/Active-Directory-Lab/blob/main/README.md)
    - Created a mini corporate Active Directory enviroment with Domain Controller, DHCP, DNS, Python User Creation, and Group Policy Object(GPO)
  - [Ubuntu AD Integration](https://github.com/Thuynh808/Ubuntu-AD-Integration/blob/main/README.md)
    - Building on from Active Directory Lab with an Ubuntu Server centralizing user management configuring network settings, joining the Ubuntu Server to the AD domain, setting up Kerberos authentication, and optimizing system configurations.
   
- **Infrastructure Automation and Monitoring**
  - [HA-WebTrack ***(New)***](https://github.com/Thuynh808/HA-WebTrack/blob/main/README.md)
    - A high-availability web server setup built with Ansible, featuring automated infrastructure deployment, load balancing with HAProxy, real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, and hands-on testing for high-load stress and failover scenarios. It emphasizes RHCSA and RHCE practices, using dynamic variables and role-based playbooks for scalability.
      
- **Cloud Security Ventures**
  - [The Cyber Streetracker ***(New)***](https://github.com/Thuynh808/TheCyberStreetracker/blob/main/README.md)
    - The Cyber Streetracker is a comprehensive web application designed to provide real-time cybersecurity news and vulnerability search capabilities, leveraging Azure services for robust functionality and security. This project implements advanced features such as OAuth2.0 authentication, Azure Functions, and a Web Application Firewall, ensuring a secure and responsive user experience. 
  - [Live SOC/Honeynet in Azure](https://github.com/Thuynh808/Cloud-SOC/blob/main/README.md)
    - Built a Honeynet in the Cloud, attracting live attackers, triggering alerts, and remediating incidents

- **Security Operations Center(SOC) Initiatives**
  - [Security Onion SOC Workshop](https://github.com/Thuynh808/Security-Onion-SOC-Workshop/blob/main/README.md)
    - A small-scale Security Operations Center (SOC) laboratory was established using Security Onion. This included tasks such as importing malicious PCAP files, generating incident cases, conducting incident response procedures, and composing detailed incident reports.
  - [Project Fishy Phiisshing](https://github.com/Thuynh808/Fishy-Phiisshing/blob/main/README.md)
    - A comprehensive analysis of phishing threats, this project leverages Python to automate the retrieval of phishing samples from a dedicated GitHub repository using the GitHub API. We'll then concentrate on examining various phishing emails, focusing on strategies and techniques. The outcomes are detailed reports that not only chronicles the findings but also serve as resources for cybersecurity awareness and education.
  - [Qualys Quest Analysis](https://github.com/Thuynh808/Qualys-Quest-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
    - In this detailed walkthrough, we establish a virtual environment to run Qualys for vulnerability assessments. With outdated applications installed to simulate potential security risks, we provide a foundation for our scans. Employing the vulnerability management cycle, we systematically scan, analyze, and remediate, demonstrating a continuous approach to managing vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we craft pivot tables to generate a trend report that documents the progression and remediation of vulnerabilities throughout the cycles.
